  - balance: "Stunbatons and stunprods now have massively increased/full armor penetration in exchange for slightly less damage overall. Stunbaton right click now does normal damage + slow over 3 seconds instead of 50 DoT + slow over 5 seconds."
  - balance: "Stunprods got buffed. Viva la revolution."
